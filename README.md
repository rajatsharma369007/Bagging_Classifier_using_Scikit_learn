# Spam Classifier using Bagging classifier

## Introduction
A Bagging classifier is an ensemble meta-estimator that fits base classifiers each on random subsets of the original dataset and then aggregate their individual predictions (either by voting or by averaging) to form a final prediction. In this notebook, you will get to know how to implement the bagging classifier using scikit learn.

## Dataset
Have a look at the dataset [link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Spam_Classifier_using_Bagging_Classifier/blob/master/SMSSpamCollection)  
Dataset contains first columns as classification label and second column is the e-mail content.

## Installation
* Pandas  
<code>conda install pandas</code>
* Scikit learn  
<code>conda install -c anaconda scikit-learn</code>

## Accuracy
* Accuracy score = 0.97
* Precision score = 0.90
* Recall score = 0.89
* F1 score = 0.90
